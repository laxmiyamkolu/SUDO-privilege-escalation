# SUDO Privilege Escalation
**Overview:**
This project demonstrates the exploitation of the Sudo privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2023-22809). The objective is to simulate how an attacker can gain unauthorized root access by exploiting this vulnerability in a controlled environment.


**Technologies Used:**

**Operating Systems:** Parrot OS, Ubuntu 

**Tools:** Sudo command, Bash scripting

**Environment:** Virtualized environment for safe testing and execution


**Steps Involved**

**Manual Attack Simulation:** First, manually simulated the vulnerability to understand its mechanics and potential impact.

**Exploit Development:** Developed a Bash script to automate the exploitation process.

**Execution:** Ran the automated script in a safe, virtualized environment to confirm the effectiveness of the exploit.

**Mitigation:** Identified and applied countermeasures to secure the system against this vulnerability.

**Documentation:** Provided detailed guidance on the attack process, automation, and mitigation strategies.


**Files Included**

**Learning Objective SUDO Privilege Escalation in LINUX:** Outlines the learning goals and objectives for understanding Sudo privilege escalation in Linux environments.

**Lab Manual SUDO Privilege Escalation in LINUX:** Provides detailed instructions for the hands-on lab simulation, including attack procedures and prevention techniques.

**Automation Script (Bash) SUDO Privilege Escalation in LINUX:** Contains the Bash script used to automate the exploitation process.

**SUDO Privilege Escalation in LINUX (PowerPoint Presentation):** Summarizes the project, including the attack simulation, automation script, and findings.


**How to Use**

Download and review the **Learning Objective** and **Lab Manual** documents for context, instructions, and prevention techniques.
